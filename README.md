# StealthOps: Procedural 3D Stealth Game

**StealthOps** is a 3D stealth espionage game where I take on the role of a spy navigating through procedurally generated environments to avoid enemy guards and complete secret missions. Every playthrough is unique thanks to the dynamic, real-time world generation. I’ve designed the game to be entirely code-based, so no need for external textures or sounds. It’s all about pure gameplay and AI-driven interactions.

## Features

- **Procedurally Generated Maps:** Each level generates a new set of obstacles, enemies, and item locations, keeping gameplay fresh and challenging.
- **AI Guard Patrols:** Enemy guards follow patrol routes, and the player must avoid their vision cones to evade detection.
- **Real-Time AI Decision Making:** If guards detect the player or suspicious activity, their patrol routes adjust dynamically, adding layers of complexity.
- **Engaging Stealth Mechanics:** Utilize crouching, hiding behind objects, and outsmarting enemies through clever movement.

## Tech Stack

- Python with PyOpenGL for 3D rendering.
- Pygame for handling input, events, and basic 3D physics.
- Procedural Generation logic to create randomized 3D environments in real-time.
- AI Behavior implemented using state machines or behavior trees for enemy decision-making.
- Pathfinding algorithms like A* for handling AI movement.

## Conclusion
I’m excited to share StealthOps with you! It’s a work in progress, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions. Let’s sneak through the shadows together!
